# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis
In this project I've created a dashboard using power BI ,for the revenue management team of AtliQ Grand hotel chain, which can provide key insights on Revenue trend.

## Problem Statement :

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


## Task :

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.


1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.

2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.



## Tools :

 - power BI - for data cleaning and visualization.



## Step by Step Process :

- Imported and transformed data in Power BI.
  - I've used Power Query to connect to input folder and expanded CSV files.
  - Performed data transformation and established relationships in data modeling.
- Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI.
- And then I've Created few filters and key performance indicators.
- Finally created dashboard using appropriate visualization.

## Insights :

- From the visualization i.e., Trends by Key Metrics we can see that Mumbai city is generating highest Revenue and the Delhi city generating lowest Revenue,So now we take actions accordingly.
- And if we observe Average Rating the AtliQ Exotica property has highest rating meanwhile AtliQ Seasons has lowest rating.
- If we see the Revenue % by Category ,the Revenue from the Luxury Category is more than the Businees Category.
- If we apply the room_class filter then we can see that Elite class is generating high revenue among all classes.
- If we check monthly ,then the highest revenue was generated in the month of May.


## Things I've learned from this project :

- I've got the hospitality domain knowledge ,and yeah having domain knowledge is really important and that will be helpful to full fill the requirements of stakeholders.

- And I've got to know few important key metrics which plays an important role in hotel revenue performance like 
  - Revenue per available room (RevPar)
  - Average Daily Rate (ADR)
  - Occupancy %
  - Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
  - Realisation %
 
- In order to create these KPI's ,I've learnt the effective usage of DAX.
- Understanding the  requirements of business based on the data and learnt how to ask right questions to stakeholders in order to prepare an effective dashboard.
- And proper usage of color palettes for creating dashboards.
